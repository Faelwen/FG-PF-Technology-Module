Cybertech	Arm	Cybernetic arm	4750 gp	9	2	DC 28	<p>A cybernetic arm completely replaces a normal arm, from the shoulder to the hand. It can take the place of an arm lost to a severing wound. The arm is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular arm, although cyberart can be added to the arm at no additional cost. A cybernetic arm does not increase a user's Strength score. If a creature has two cybernetic arms, it can lift and carry double the normal maximum weight for that creature's Strength and size, and it gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. A character who wields a one-handed or light weapon with a cybernetic arm gains a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts; two cybernetic arms do not increase this bonus, but do allow the bonus to apply to two-handed weapons.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 2,375 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Arm	Implanted weaponry	10000 gp	1	2	DC 26	<p>A single light melee weapon or one-handed firearm can be implanted in an arm or cybernetic arm. Melee weapons extend or retract as a swift action. Ranged weapons fire through a port on the palm or back of the wrist. Either type of weapon has statistics identical to its normal form. Firearms reload through a breach in the arm, increasing the reloading time of the weapon to a full-round action, or doubling reloading times that already take a full round or longer. Implanted weapons are well concealed; detecting one requires a thorough search (Perception DC 25). Implanted weaponry can be damaged or destroyed by sundering, but cannot be disarmed. Weaponry installed in a cybernetic arm does not count against a creature's implantation limit. The cost, price, and weight of the weapon to be implanted are added to the cost, price, and weight listed in this stat block.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 5,000 gp (special), craft cybertech, cybernetics lab, weapon to be implanted

Cybertech	Brain	Frenzychip	36400 gp	1	1	DC 32	<p>A frenzychip is installed into a creature's brain. Successful implantation leaves no trace of the operation. Once in place, a frenzychip patches directly in to the patient's motor skills and emotions. As long as she's not fatigued or exhausted, the user of a frenzychip can activate it as a swift action. While active, it grants a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a +1 morale bonus on Reflex saving throws, and a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. The user may use a frenzychip for up to 10 rounds per day, though the rounds need not be consecutive. Once the effects end, she becomes fatigued for twice as many rounds as she was under the frenzychip's effects.</p>	Craft DC 30; Cost 18,200 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Brain	Skillslot	2000 gp	1	1	DC 30	<p>A skillslot is implanted into the target's brain, leaving a small port at the base of the skull. This port is covered with a flap of skin when not in use. Once installed, a skillslot has no effect until a skillchip is inserted into the port (see here for information on the various forms of available skillchips.) An inserted skillchip enhances the user's ability in the skill encoded on the chip; the magnitude to which the skill is enhanced depends on the power of the skillchip. This does not grant ranks in the associated skill. It takes 10 minutes for a skillchip to adjust itself to a new skillslot; during this time, the user takes a -2 penalty on all skill checks as distracting sensations flood his mind. When a skillchip is removed, its benefits end immediately, but the wearer suffers no ill effects.</p>	Craft DC 28; Cost 1,000 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Ears	Cybernetic ears	4000 gp	1	1	DC 28	<p>A cybernetic ear can be enhanced by cyberart at no additional cost, giving it an unusual color or shape. When a pair of ears is installed, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks. This bonus stacks with circumstance bonuses on Perception checks from other cybernetic senses. Cybernetic ears grant a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against sonic effects.</p><p>The listed price, implantation value, and install DC are for having both ears installed. A single cybernetic ear costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but a creature must replace all of its ears to receive the benefits above.</p>	Craft DC 28; Cost 2,000 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Eyes	Cybernetic eyes	4000 gp	1	1	DC 28	<p>A cybernetic eye can be enhanced by cyber art for no additional cost. When a pair of eyes is installed, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against blindness or visual effects. The bonus on Perception checks stacks with circumstance bonuses on Perception checks from other cybernetic sources. A pair of cybernetic eyes can be further enhanced by one veemod at a price equal to twice the veemod's normal price.</p><p>The listed price, implantation value, and install DC are for having two eyes installed. A single cybernetic eye costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but a creature must replace all of its eyes to receive the benefits above.</p>	Craft DC 28; Cost 2,000 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Head	Cranial bomb	4500 gp	0.5	1	DC 25	<p>A cranial bomb is a bomb implanted at the base of the skull that explodes when remotely activated by a detonator's signal. Though normally implanted, a cranial bomb can also be detonated outside of a body. If detonated while implanted, it deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage, and the recipient must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or be instantly slain. Creatures killed in this manner cannot be revived by <i>breath of life</i> or <i>raise dead</i>. If detonated outside a body, the bomb instead creates a small explosion, dealing the damage detailed above in a 5-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 13 half).</p>	Craft DC 20; Cost 2,250 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Legs	Cybernetic legs	8500 gp	12	4	DC 28	<p>A cybernetic leg completely replaces a normal leg, from the hip to the foot. It can take the place of a leg lost to a severing wound. The leg is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular leg, although cyberart can be added to the leg at no additional cost. A cybernetic leg does not increase a user's Strength score. If both legs are replaced, they increase the user's base land speed by 10 feet and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against trip attempts and a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks.</p><p>The listed price, implantation, and install DC are for having two legs installed. A single cybernetic leg costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but no significant bonus is granted to a creature with only one cybernetic leg. Both legs (or all legs, in the case of multi-legged creatures) must be replaced for the above benefits to take effect.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 4,250 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
Cybertech	Slotless	Cyberart	100 gp	1	0	DC 20	<p>Cyberart is the least invasive of all cybertech. This implant is similar in appearance to a tattoo, except that it can glow softly if desired, providing illumination equal to that provided by a candle. Some cyberart is animated, providing a short looping scene that replays over and over. Cyberart is installed in a body with a small metallic stylus that injects low-grade nanites into a body part; the quality of the art relies on the installer's Craft (painting or tattoo) check.</p>	Craft DC 20; Cost 50 gp, craft cybertech, cybernetics lab
