<h1 id = "technology-guide-weapons">Weapons</h1>
<p>Each technological weapon has a full description, including a set of abbreviated statistics. This information is organized as follows.</p>
<p><b>Price</b>: This is the cost (in gold pieces) to purchase the weapon if it's available for sale. As with magic weapons, a technological weapon can be sold by PCs for half this value.</p>
<p><b>Type</b>: This indicates whether the weapon is a light, one-handed, or two-handed melee or ranged weapon.</p>
<p><b>Proficiency</b>: This entry lists whether the weapon is simple, martial, or exotic. If an existing weapon proficiency allows the new weapon's use, that weapon proficiency is listed in parentheses. Note that Exotic Weapon Proficiency (heavy weaponry) works similarly to Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) in that it allows access to a wide range of similar weapons.</p>
<p>Some GMs may wish to replace Weapon Proficiency (firearms) with Weapon Proficiency (technological firearms) to further restrict access to these devices to player characters in their campaigns. </p>
<p><b>Damage</b>: This is the weapon's base damage. The type of damage dealt by the weapon is listed after the damage value. Most weapons list the damage dealt by Medium and Small versions of the weapon; weapons with only one damage entry deal the same amount of damage regardless of size.</p>
<p><b>Critical</b>: This entry lists the weapon's critical threat range and critical damage multiplier.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: This lists the weapon's range increment; no listing is given for melee weapons that cannot be thrown. Unless otherwise noted, all firearms in this chapter are treated as projectile weapons for the purpose of determining their maximum range.</p>
<p><b>Capacity</b>: Unless otherwise specified, this value is the maximum number of charges the weapon can hold.</p>
<p><b>Usage</b>: This value lists the number of charges the weapon consumes from its capacity each time it is activated.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: This entry lists any special weapon qualities the weapon might have. New weapon qualities are listed below. </p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: This is the weight of the weapon in pounds. The weights given are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much; a Large weapon weighs twice as much.</p>
<p><i>Automatic</i>: This weapon can act as a semi-automatic weapon (see below), or it can fire a burst of shots with a single pull of the trigger to attack all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the wielder's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it cannot penetrate. When using an automatic weapon to attack all creatures in a line, the wielder makes a separate attack roll against each creature in the line. Each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/blur.html#blur"><i>blur</i></a>, <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/invisibility.html#invisibility"><i>invisibility</i></a>, or <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/mirrorImage.html#mirror-image"><i>mirror image</i></a> spells, do not affect an automatic weapon's line attack. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately. A single burst with an automatic weapon consumes 10 charges. When taking a full-attack action with an automatic weapon, the wielder can fire as many bursts in a round as he has attacks, provided he has enough charges to make all of the attacks.</p>
<p><i>Semi-Automatic</i>: A semi-automatic weapon normally fires one shot as an attack. However, the user can take a full-attack action to fire twice, as if using the Rapid Shot feat (including taking a -2 penalty on all attacks). If the wielder has the Rapid Shot feat, she can use the additional shot from that as well, but the penalty for all shots fired in that round increases to -6.</p>
<p><i>Slow-Firing</i>: A slow-firing weapon requires a full-round action to use, and thus cannot be used to make iterative attacks.</p>
<p><i>Touch</i>: Attacks with the weapon resolve as touch attacks.</p>
<p><b>Description</b>: This section describes the weapon's abilities and appearance.</p>
<p><b>Construction</b>: Certain requirements must be met for a character to craft a technological weapon. These requirements generally consist of having a feat and access to a particular kind of <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/technologyGuide/crafting.html#crafting-laboratories">manufacturing facility</a>.</p>
<p><b>Craft</b>: This is the Craft DC required to create the weapon. It is also the Knowledge (engineering) DC to correctly identify the weapon.</p>
<p><b>Cost</b>: This is the cost in gold pieces to create the weapon. Generally this cost is equal to half the price of the weapon.</p>
