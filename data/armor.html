<p>Each suit of technological armor has a full description, including a set of abbreviated statistics. This information is organized as follows.</p>
<p><b>Price</b>: This is the cost in gold pieces to purchase the suit of armor if it's available for sale. As with magic armor, a technological suit of armor can be sold by PCs for half this value.</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: The weight of the armor in pounds. Weight figures are for armor sized to fit Medium characters. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor fitted for Large characters weighs twice as much.</p>
<p><b>Type</b>: This indicates if the suit is light, medium, or heavy armor.</p>
<p><b>AC</b>: The protective value of the armor. This armor bonus is added to the wearer's Armor Class.</p>
<p><b>Max Dex</b>: This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus that this type of armor allows.</p>
<p><b>Penalty</b>: This lists the armor check penalty of the suit of armor.</p>
<p><b>Spell Failure</b>: This indicates the armor's arcane spell failure chance.</p>
<p><b>Speed</b>: This lists a character's adjusted speed while wearing the armor. Adjusted speeds for characters with base speeds of 20 ft. and 30 ft. are included.</p>
<p><b>Capacity</b>: The armor's charge capacity is listed here. If the armor doesn't use energy, this entry is omitted.</p>
<p><b>Usage</b>: This value lists the number of charges the armor consumes over time while activated. (Activating powered armor is a standard action, and deactivating is a free action.) The charge is immediately spent at the beginning of the duration, and any time remaining when the armor is deactivated is lost. </p>
<p><b>Description</b>: This describes the armor's appearance, powers, and abilities.</p>
<p><b>Construction</b>: Certain requirements must be met for a character to craft a suit of technological armor. These requirements generally consist of having a feat and access to a manufacturing facility.</p>
<p><b>Craft</b>: This is the Craft DC required to create the armor. It is also the Knowledge (engineering) DC to correctly identify the armor.</p>
<p><b>Cost</b>: This is the cost in gold pieces to create the technological item. Generally, this cost is equal to half the price of the armor.</p>
