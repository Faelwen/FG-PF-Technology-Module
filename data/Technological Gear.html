<p><b>Slot</b>: This is the part of the body the item must be worn on, if any. If the item's slot matches one of the existing magic item slots, wearing the item prevents the user from wearing or gaining the benefit from a magic item in the same slot.</p>

<p><b>Description</b>: This section describes the gear's appearance and abilities.</p>
<p><b>Construction</b>: This section describes the requirements that must be met for a character to craft the item. These requirements generally consist of having a feat and access to a manufacturing facility.</p>
<p><b>Craft</b>: This is the Craft DC required to create the item. It is also the Knowledge (engineering) DC to correctly identify the item.</p>
<p><b>Cost</b>: This amount is the cost in gold pieces to create the item. Generally, this cost is equal to half the price of the item.</p>

<h>On Signals</h>
<p>Some items, like chipfinders, commsets, and detonators, can remotely interact with other objects via signals. Signals have a maximum range set by the device. Furthermore, a signal cannot penetrate solid barriers well. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals at all. Signal boosters and signal jammers can also affect signal range.</p>
