Access card	varies	<p>An access card is a small strip of stiff plastic with a color-coded stripe on one side. Some access cards are further decorated with names or titles written in Androffan, or even photographs of long-dead crew members. An access card functions as a key—when swiped through an electronic lock (a move action), an access card unlocks any lock of its color code or a color code of a lower rating. Although access cards do not consume energy themselves, they work in only electronic locks that currently have power. Among certain societies, access cards are also used as decorations, worn as affectations, and incorporated into ceremonial regalia.</p><p>Access cards must be encoded to specific locks before they can function. Often, all of the doors in a complex are keyed to a unique set of cards that don't work on doors found in other complexes, much like a skeleton key might open all the doors in one castle but none in another. Coding an access card for specific locks requires a lock coder. Some access cards could be worth far more than the prices listed above if they're specifically encoded to locks that protect more valuable or significant contents.</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>	
Battery	100 gp	"<p>Most technological items are powered by electricity. While one can use the electricity provided by a generator, these are rare, expensive, and rarely portable. It's more common and practical to charge such items with batteries. A battery looks like a small silver disk that's etched with strange lines—some people have taken to calling batteries ""silverdisks"" and sometimes use them as coins. A battery contains 10 charges when full; to charge an item with a battery, one simply slips the disk-shaped device into the proper slot on the item. The battery's charge instantly fully depletes, and the item's internal capacitors fill with 10 charges as it does so. If the item had fewer than 10 open slots in its capacity, the excess charges the battery once held are lost. A battery can be kept within an object indefinitely, or it can be ejected from the object for the purposes of recharging it or storing it elsewhere without affecting the item's charge. Inserting or ejecting a battery is a move action.</p><p>Placing a battery in a generator's charging slot can recharge it. However, each time a battery is recharged, there's a 20% chance that the battery is destroyed in the process. A destroyed battery is worth only 10 gp. The bulk of ""silverdisks"" in circulation today are destroyed batteries; one can tell a functional battery from a destroyed one by the way the circuitry seems to shimmer slightly when reflecting light. The circuitry in a charged battery glows with a soft blue radiance equal to that of a candle.</p>"	Craft DC 25; Cost 50 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Camera	3000 gp	<p>This handheld device can capture still photographs or record video. The device uses a charge when activated and consumes an additional charge each hour; during that hour, individual photographs or video recordings do not consume additional charges. Images and videos captured by a camera can be displayed on the camera's palm-sized screen. A camera can hold up to 20 hours of video footage and 200 photographs.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 1,500 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Chemalyzer	2500 gp	<p>A chemalyzer is a handheld unit with an extendable wand tipped with a sampling nozzle. It grants a +5 competence bonus on all Craft (alchemy) or Knowledge (engineering) checks to identify an unknown pharmaceutical, poison, chemical, or substance. It cannot aid in the identification of magical effects or items like potions.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 1,250 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Chipfinder	varies	<p>A chipfinder is a handheld device fitted with a circular screen. When a chipfinder is activated, all active tracker chips within a certain radius appear as glowing dots on the screen, indicating the direction and approximate distance to each installed tracker chip, as well identification number for each chip. The screen can filter out unwanted data to make it easier to track a specific chip. Chipfinders are color-coded items; the higher the chipfinder's color rating, the longer its range. This range is a signal, and can be enhanced by a signal booster or blocked by a solid enough barrier.</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>	
Clonepod	60000 gp	<p>A clonepod looks like a human-sized capsule with a blue window at head height and a bank of touch-sensitive screens and buttons at chest height. A small slot situated below the window can accept genetic material (fingernails, hair clippings, skin samples, and so forth). When genetic material is placed in the slot, the clonepod immediately atomizes the sample and processes the genetic information. At this point, activating the clonepod causes its interior to flood with blue biotic fluid, which is then supersaturated with a combination of proteins, nanites, and other materials. Over the course of the next 12 hours, the clonepod works nonstop to produce an exact replica of the creature from which the genetic material was harvested, as the creature was when the sample was taken. A clonepod can only duplicate a Medium or smaller creature—attempts to clone a larger creature result in a hideous, partially formed monstrosity that heaves and gasps a few times before dying.</p><p>The completed clone can remain in stasis inside the pod indefinitely as long as the seals are not broken. The clone created is alive, yet has no mind until a neurocam is used to upload a mind into the clone's brain. A clone has the same Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the original body. A clone that is awoken before any mind is uploaded into it has no Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both 1.</p><p>Uploading a mind from a neurocam into a clone takes 10 minutes. If the mind belonged to the same creature that was used to grow the clone, it immediately comes back to life as if under the effects of a <i>clone</i> spell (including 2 negative levels or 2 points of Constitution drain)—provided the user's soul has not yet passed to the Boneyard and been judged.  It possesses the same Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of the original mind, all of that creature's skills, and most of the memories and personality of the creature (though there may be gaps or differences). A mind uploaded into a clone after its soul has been judged results in a soulless approximation of the original. Such a creature has its Charisma permanently reduced by 2 points (which cannot be restored), and has no ability to grow more powerful or gain levels (similar to a <i>simulacrum</i>).</p><p>If the clone's body and mind are not from the same source, all six ability scores are permanently reduced by 2 points.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 30,000 gp, craft technological item, nanotech lab
Commset	6000 gp	<p>This handheld device allows for communication between two commset users. A commset carries audio and visual signals, and includes a built-in camera that can record all communications being broadcast. Communication between two commsets requires both users to tune their individual devices to the same frequency. A commset has a range of 1 mile—beyond this range, communication is impossible without enhancing the signal strength with a signal booster. The price and cost listed for this item are for a single commset.</p>	Craft DC 27; Cost 3,000 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Cortex gun	varies	<p>A cortex gun is an incredibly powerful device filled with nanites programmed for physical and mental enhancement. The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the Technologist feat succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p><p>A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the cortex gun's programming was scrambled, the nanites die without doing any harm or aid to the target.</p><p>If the cortex gun was properly programmed to one of the six ability scores, the nanites swiftly disperse through the user's body, enhancing and augmenting that ability score over the course of several days. These augmentations are inherent bonuses, and increase the ability score by 1 every 24 hours that pass until the cortex gun's maximum bonus is reached.</p><p>A cortex gun can only function on living corporeal creatures, but a living creature with a bonus granted by a cortex gun that dies and becomes undead retains that bonus in undeath.</p><p>A cortex gun can only be used once before it becomes useless. The final total inherent bonus granted by the cortex gun, as well as its price, cost to create, and Craft DC are as follows.</p>	
Cylex	3600 gp	<p>Cylex is an exceptionally stable form of explosive that can be shaped at room temperature, like soft clay. Neon green in color, a single charge of cylex can be triggered to explode by using a detonator (see below) or applying 10 or more points of electricity damage to it in a single action. When detonated, a single use of cylex explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in the area of effect. A successful DC 17 Reflex saving throw halves the damage.</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 1,800 gp, craft technological arms and armor, military lab
Detonator	500 gp	<p>A detonator is a small device that can be used to trigger cranial bombs, cylex, and other explosives remotely. While an explosive is being set, the user can key the explosive to a detonator with a standard action that costs the detonator one charge. Once the explosive is keyed, as a standard action the user can push a button to trigger the explosive. A typical detonator has a range of 1,000 feet—though some may have a reduced range (intentionally or otherwise) and others might be enhanced by a signal booster.</p>	Craft DC 23; Cost 250 gp, craft technological item, military lab
E-pick	varies	"<p>An e-pick (short for ""electronic lock pick"") is a small device that can be used to unlock and disable electronic locks and devices, much in the same way that a set of thieves' tools can be used to dismantle mechanical locks and devices. Brown e-picks allow a user to make Disable Device checks against electronic devices without penalty; those of higher ratings also grant a competence bonus (as indicated below).

Emergency beacon	900 gp	<p>An emergency beacon is a small, pod-shaped device that emits a bright red flash from a dome on its top once every 6 seconds when activated. The beacon also transmits its location. Any device capable of receiving signals of any sort can pick up a beacon's signal, which can then be tracked back to the source with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) or Survival check. A beacon's transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, but this range is halved in forests or hills, and quartered in mountainous terrain or through water.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 450 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Emergency raft	3600 gp	<p>An emergency raft initially looks like a bright red plastic cylinder, 6 inches wide and 2 feet long. When activated, it rapidly inflates into a tough little boat that measures 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. It can hold four Medium creatures. The raft comes with two pairs of collapsible, dense plastic oars to row with. The raft can be commanded to compact back into its portable shape at a touch of a button, as long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside. An emergency raft only consumes charges when commanded to unfold or compact.</p>	Craft DC 24; Cost 1,800 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Emergency shelter	18000 gp	<p>An emergency shelter is a small, 2-foot-long egg-shaped device that can be activated with the touch of a button (a standard action). Once activated, the shelter rapidly unfolds and inflates into a 10-foot-radius hut capable of providing shelter for up to six Medium creatures. This process takes 1 minute to complete. The shelter includes pneumatic spike anchors that can attach it to any ground cover of hardness 8 or less. Several windows allow those inside to see outside. The interior contains several fluorescent lights. The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, and provides excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and purifies any noxious external air into breathable air. The hut has fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and acid resistance 10. The dense plastic walls have hardness 8 and 10 hit points. The hut cannot float on water. The door is self-sealing, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease for as long as the power holds out. As long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside an emergency shelter, it can be commanded at the touch of a button to compact back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute. After this point, the device consumes 1 charge over the course of 8 hours resetting its internal structure, limiting its deployment to 3 times a day at most.</p>	Craft DC 27; Cost 9,000 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Filter mask	4500 gp	<p>A filter mask is a clear plastic shield worn over the entire face. The mask has ionized filters and scrubbers that purify the air the user breathes in and give the mask an unintentionally fearsome look. While the mask has power, the wearer is completely immune to inhaled toxins or diseases. Even when the mask has no power, it grants the wearer a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws made to resist airborne toxins and diseases.</p>	Craft DC 24; Cost 2,250 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Fire extinguisher	6000 gp	<p>This cylindrical device has a nozzle at one end and a handle on one side. When activated as a standard action, a fire extinguisher creates a 15-foot cone of misty vapor that swiftly extinguishes fires within its area of effect. Against magical fire effects, such as those created by a <i>wall of fire</i> or similar spell, the fire extinguisher only extinguishes the part of the larger effect its vapors directly contact. Continual magic flames, such as those of a <i>flaming</i> weapon or fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds before they automatically reignite. To extinguish an instantaneous fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect, provided the source of the effect is in the extinguisher's area of effect.</p><p>When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast from a fire extinguisher deals 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 15 halves). A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilated—using a fire extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in slow suffocation (at the GM's discretion).</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 3,000 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Flashlight	30 gp	<p>When activated, a flashlight creates a beam of normal light in a 60-foot cone. It also increases the light level in the area beyond this initial cone by one step, out to a 120-foot cone. It does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A flashlight has no effect in areas of magical darkness.</p>	Craft DC 16; Cost 15 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Force field	varies	<p>Force fields are powered by a surprisingly light pair of slender, silvery bracelets. When activated as a standard action, dozens of tiny biofeedback needles pierce the wearer's arms to interface with the nervous system; this process is somewhat painful and the wearer must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being dazed for 1 round as the force field is activated. Once active, the device generates an invisible and intangible field of force around the target. The force field blocks solids and liquids, but not gases or light (including laser beams). The user of a force field can still breathe, but she cannot eat or drink.</p><p>Activating a force field is a standard action that consumes 1 charge, after which point the field consumes 1 additional charge every minute it remains active. While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours. Force fields are automatically reduced to 0 hp by disintegration effects. A force field can be deactivated as a free action.</p><p>The charge capacity, amount of temporary hit points granted, and rate of fast healing these temporary hit points have varies according to the force field's color code, as detailed below.</p><p>Craft Technological Item, graviton lab</p>	
Goo tube	6 gp	<p>Goo tubes are a form of preserved food. A single goo tube is a malleable cylinder with a cap on one end; when it's opened and squeezed, the colorful, goopy contents are extruded. Although the texture and appearance of this goo is unappetizing, the paste is actually quite tasty, and comes in a mind-boggling assortment of flavors. A symbol on the side of the tube often grants a clue as to what flavor may be contained within, but these symbols can sometimes be counter-intuitive. The contents of a single goo tube can provide nourishment for a day for one Medium-size creature.</p>	Craft DC 14; Cost 3 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Gravity clip	2000 gp	<p>A gravity clip is a small, disc-shaped device that can be attached to any melee weapon. Once mounted, the clip modulates the weapon's mass on the moment of impact, via the manipulation of the gravity fields around the weapon. Each successful hit against a target consumes a charge from a gravity clip and causes the damage from the hit to resolve as if the weapon were one size category larger than its actual size. This effect does not stack with similar effects, such as those granted by the spell <i>lead blades</i>.</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 1,000 gp, craft technological item, graviton lab
Grenade	varies	"<p>A grenade is a small, cylindrical device that is designed to be thrown as a splash weapon or fired from a grenade launcher. Before being thrown by hand, the grenade must be primed with a quick twist of a dial at one end and then armed with a click of a button at the center of that dial. Priming and arming a grenade is a free action; a grenade launcher primes and arms all grenades it fires. The grenade detonates at the beginning of the wielder's next turn, hopefully in the area targeted. When a grenade detonates, it damages all targets within a 20-foot-radius spread. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves any damage dealt by a grenade.</p><p>The type of damage dealt by grenades varies widely and depends upon the nature of the specific grenade. The different types of grenades and the damage types they deal (along with any additional effects their damage deals) are listed below.</p><ul><li><b>Arc Grenade</b>: Deals 5d6 points of electricity damage.</li>
<li><b>Atom Grenade</b>: Creates a 20-foot-radius area of medium radiation that persists for 24 hours.</li>

Grippers	100 gp	<p>Grippers are powerful, long-handled tools that resemble a blacksmith's tongs. Once they're set, they can be locked into place to grip an object. Used when attempting to pry open a stuck object (in a manner similar to the use of a crowbar), grippers grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks. When used to attach two devices, a set of grippers holds on with an effective Strength score of 24. Applying grippers to a creature and then locking the grippers to crush flesh and bone is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and also requires a successful melee attack with an improvised weapon. Once locked, the grippers deal 1d4+7 points of damage.</p>	Craft DC 14; Cost 50 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Hologram generator	varies	<p>A hologram generator is a handheld device with a long, thin barrel. It manipulates photons and sound waves to produce highly realistic images and sounds, similar in nature to those generated by figment illusions.</p><p>Before a hologram generator can generate an image, though, it must store the image in its memory. The maximum size and maximum number of images a generator can store vary according to its color, but storing an image is a standard action regardless of the strength of the generator. More powerful generators can store moving images and sounds, or even generate illusions that interact with their environments.</p><p>Once a hologram generator's memory is full, additional images overwrite existing images as chosen by the user at the time of their recording.</p><p>Generating a hologram is a standard action. If the hologram generator is then left alone, it continues to project the image until it depletes its charges. Alternatively, the user can aim the hologram at a different location as a move action.</p><p>A hologram generator is a color-coded item, and the particulars of its abilities, including its energy capacity, the range at which it can create its holograms, and the Will save DC to disbelieve the hologram if it is interacted with, vary as detailed below.</p><p><b>Brown Hologram Generator</b>: A brown hologram generator can create only a static, motionless image no larger than a Small creature, and can store only one such image.</p><p><b>Black Hologram Generator</b>: A black hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Medium creature, and can store three images.</p><p><b>White Hologram Generator</b>: A white hologram generator can create a static, motionless image no larger than a Large creature, and can store five images.</p><p><b>Gray Hologram Generator</b>: A gray hologram generator functions as a white hologram generator (and can store up to seven images), but can also store up to 1 minute of moving imagery as well. A moving hologram can move anywhere in range of the generator, as long as the user continues to take a move action each round to aim and direct the motion. An unattended generator's hologram cannot leave its imagery, but it can be mobile in that area.</p><p><b>Green Hologram Generator</b>: A green hologram generator functions as a gray one, except that it can incorporate sound as well, with all appropriate sound coming from the image. It can store up to nine images or 2 minutes of moving imagery. It can store images equal in size to a Huge or smaller creature.</p><p><b>Red Hologram Generator</b>: A red hologram generator functions as a green one, except that it can create two images within range simultaneously. Directing these images is a free action. A red hologram generator can store up to 11 images or 3 minutes of moving imagery.</p><p><b>Blue Hologram Generator</b>: A blue hologram generator functions as a red one, except that it can create three images simultaneously, can store up to 13 images, and can play up to 4 minutes of moving imagery.</p><p><b>Orange Hologram Generator</b>: An orange hologram generator functions as a blue one, except that it can create up to four images simultaneously, can store up to 15 images, and can play up to 4 minutes of moving imagery. In addition, it can store images equal in size to a Gargantuan or smaller creature.</p><p><b>Prismatic Hologram Generator</b>: A prismatic hologram generator functions as an orange one. As long as only one image is created, the image is further enhanced by graviton fields, which give it the ability to interact with the environment. (Such images still last for only 4 minutes.) A barrier generated by a prismatic hologram generator has hardness 10 and 50 hit points (break DC 28). A creature generated in this manner can be directed to attack targets. The creature can make only one attack per round regardless of its appearance, attacking at the wielder's base attack bonus modified by the wielder's Intelligence score.

Inertial dampening belt	10000 gp	<p>When activated, an inertial dampening belt anchors the wearer in place, protecting her against outside forces. This effect gives the wearer a +4 bonus to her combat maneuver defense against bull rush, reposition, and trip attempts, consuming 1 charge per minute. If the wearer falls from a height of greater than 10 feet, the inertial dampening belt automatically activates just prior to impact and reduces the falling damage by half, consuming 1 charge per die of falling damage. If the belt has insufficient charges to reduce the entire amount of damage, the damage is not reduced for the excess dice. Damage from landing on hazardous objects such as spikes is not reduced.</p>	Craft DC 28; Cost 5,000 gp, craft technological item, graviton lab
Ion tape	100 gp	<p>Ion tape is a ribbon of material tightly wound around a spindle. A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zip stick), the tape bonds together into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 30 hit points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many—it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.</p>	Craft DC 14; Cost 50 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Jetpack	18000 gp	<p>A jetpack consists of a pair of cylindrical tanks worn on a shoulder harness with a pair of motion-sensitive rings worn on the thumbs that are used as wireless thrust and attitude controls. The jetpack can be activated as a swift action and grants a fly speed of 60 feet with poor maneuverability. If the wearer successfully hovers near ground level, she obscures visibility as though she had the Hover feat. The exhaust isn't hot or concentrated enough to be used as a weapon.</p><p>A jetpack can be operated in overdrive, giving the wearer a fly speed of 90 feet with clumsy maneuverability and consuming twice as many charges per round.</p><p>While it is normally possible to wear an item in the shoulders slot as well as an item on the back, a jetpack's bulk precludes the wearer also using a backpack, <i>handy haversack</i>, or other items worn on the back.</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 9,000 gp, craft technological item, military lab
Laser sight	8000 gp	<p>This small, cylindrical device can be attached to the barrel of any firearm. When activated, it emits a low-power laser beam that paints a small red dot on the target.

Once triggered, a lighter's flame (which gives illumination as a candle) continues to burn as long as the lighter's trigger is depressed, consuming energy at the rate of 1 charge per hour. The flame can be used to light larger items on fire, but is not large enough to cause significant damage on its own.</p>	Craft DC 11; Cost 5 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Lock coder	varies	<p>A lock coder is a bulky device capable of encoding an access card with the capability to open specific electronic locks of a rating equal to or lower than its own. The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians.

Medlance	500 gp	<p>This wand-like device contains a reservoir at one end and a small pad at the other. A medlance can be filled with a single dose of liquid, such as a pharmaceutical, a potion, or a poison. It can then be used to administer the liquid to a creature—if the target does not wish to be injected with the medlance's contents, the wielder must succeed at a touch attack to dispense it as a standard action. Otherwise, administering liquid via a medlance is a move action. A medlance doesn't use charges, but after being used to administer 10 injections, its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and the device becomes useless.</p>	Craft DC 23; Cost 250 gp, craft technological item, medical lab

The device monitors and interprets motion in a 30-foot radius, but must be deployed in a sweeping motion to function—this is a move action that consumes a charge. When used, the device grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks against moving objects within 30 feet that are size Tiny or larger.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 5,000 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Nanite canister	500 gp	<p>A nanite canister is used to power technological devices that use nanites—such items generally don't require other sources of power, as the nanites themselves do the bulk of the work when the object is activated. The canister contains a small, independent power source and a supply of nanites. A single canister contains enough nanites to provide 10 charges for a nanotech item or weapon.</p>	Craft DC 25; Cost 250 gp, craft technological item, nanotech lab
Nanite hypogun	varies	<p>Nanite hypoguns inject specialized nanites into a creature's body to heal many sorts of physical and mental injuries. Injecting someone with a nanite hypogun requires a touch attack. Nine categories of nanite hypogun exist along the color code scale, as detailed below. All nanite hypoguns have two settings. On the primary setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect determined by its color—these effects mimic specific restorative spells as indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound ability can be healed).</p><p>A nanite hypogun functions only on a living, corporeal creature. It has no effect on undead creatures whatsoever.</p><p>Craft Technological Item, nanotech lab</p>	
Neurocam	36000 gp	<p>A neurocam consists of a strange helmet covered in flashing lights and adjustable straps with an intricate blinder that covers the eyes. This device is used to make a duplicate of a creature's mind, copying and storing all the knowledge, memories, and personality of a living creature. A neurocam can be adjusted to fit the head of any creature of size Tiny to Large. A neurocam interfaces with the subject's brain via a modulated beam of light that is transmitted through the optic nerves and several fine sensors that must press against the user's skull. Storing a person's mind takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted use; any interruption scrambles the pattern and ruins the neurocam. This process does not harm the target. An unwilling subject can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to resist a neurocam; if the subject is successful, the neurocam's contents are scrambled and the device is ruined.</p><p>A neurocam can store only one personality. Once used, it cannot store another even after the contents are uploaded elsewhere. A personality stored in a neurocam is effectively put into stasis—the mind does not age, nor does it gain new experiences or knowledge. It's cut off from the world, and though it experiences strange dreams, it isn't aware of the passage of time. If the neurocam is destroyed, the stored personality vanishes; however, loss of power does not harm a stored personality. </p><p>A stored personality can be uploaded only once. It can be uploaded into a blank clone in a clonepod. Additional processes to upload a stored personality into a robot or an AI core exist but are complex and often drive the stored personality insane.</p>	Craft DC 28; Cost 18,000 gp, craft technological item, cybernetics lab
Power cable	500 gp	<p>A power cable is a short length of flexible cord (typically no more than 5 feet long) that can be used to attach a technological device to a power generator. It takes a move action to attach a cable to a generator or a device—thus, it takes a full round to fully connect the two together. Once connected, the item draws power from the generator rather than from its internal battery stores. If an item can be recharged, it automatically replenishes its missing charges from the generator (up to the generator's available yield for that hour). This process is instantaneous. See Artifacts for more information on generators.</p>	Craft DC 20; Cost 250 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Power receiver	5000 gp	<p>A power receiver is a device that attaches to any technological item's battery slot. The power receiver is then set to the same frequency as a nearby power generator capable of broadcasting power, after which the device draws power from the generator as if it were attached via a power cable. The generator determines the range at which the device can draw power; this signal can be enhanced by a signal booster or blocked by a signal jammer.</p>	Craft DC 30; Cost 2,500 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Quantum box	40000 gp (for a pair)	<p>This silvery box holds up to 1 cubic foot of items or material. Quantum boxes always exist as a pair. When activated as a standard action, a quantum box connects to its mate, at which point they trade contents. A quantum box must be activated again to switch the contents back. Effects that prevent dimensional travel block activation of a quantum box, but items that block signals do not. This effect works only if both quantum boxes are located on the same plane.</p>	Craft DC 32; Cost 20,000 gp, craft technological item, graviton lab
Radiation detector	2000 gp	<p>This device measures radiation levels in a 120-foot-radius circle, as the <i>detect radiation</i> spell. When activated, the device makes a soft clicking sound that changes in volume and frequency according to the radiation level encountered. A small screen on the top of the handheld device indicates the approximate source and strength of radiation in these areas, with red areas indicating severe radiation, yellow high radiation, green medium radiation, and blue low radiation. Areas with less radiation don't register on the device's screen.</p>	Craft DC 27; Cost 1,000 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Robojack	30000 gp	<p>A robojack is a strange, rod-like device that can be used to usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In order to gain control of a robot, the wielder must first make a ranged touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the robot must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw to prevent the robojack from linking to the robot's command processor. On a subsequent turn after a link is established, the wielder can issue a command to the robot as a standard action—each attempt to do so consumes 1 charge from the robojack, and the robot gets a new DC 14 Will saving throw to resist following each command. The wielder must be within 60 feet of the robot and must issue the command in a language understood by the robot. The types of commands he can issue are similar to those allowed by a <i>suggestion</i> spell—once a command is successfully issued, the robot does its best to carry out the orders over the course of the next hour. This does not drain further charges from the robojack.</p>	Craft DC 29; Cost 15,000 gp, craft technological item, military lab
Signal booster	9000 gp	<p>This spherical object is the size of a human head. When it's activated, several panels on its surface fold back and extend dozens of arms tipped with cup-shaped flashing lights. Once activated, a signal booster amplifies the strength of any signal-based technology effect within 600 feet, doubling the effective range of the signal. For example, a commset normally has a range of 1 mile, but in the area of effect of a signal booster, this range increases to 2 miles.</p>	Craft DC 24; Cost 4,500 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Signal jammer	10000 gp	<p>This small device emits a low, hissing sound when activated. While active, a white noise generator creates a 60-foot-radius spread in which all signals are completely blocked.</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 5,000 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Skillchip	varies	<p>A skillchip contains a wealth of knowledge and lore concerning a single skill. Skillchips for skills like Craft, Knowledge, Perform, and Profession that have multiple subcategories each encode only one subcategory; a user can have a Knowledge (engineering) skillchip, but there are no general Knowledge or Craft skillchips. In order for a user to access a skillchip's lore, it must be inserted into an active skillslot.</p><p>The magnitude of the bonus granted by a skillchip varies, ranging from a +2 enhancement bonus to a +10 enhancement bonus, as summarized on the following table.</p><p>Craft Technological Item, at least 10 ranks in skill to be encoded, cybernetics lab</p>	
Tracker chip	500 gp	<p>A tracker chip appears to be a bit of metal the size of a small fingernail. Before a tracker chip activates, it must be implanted in a living creature just under the skin. This procedure takes 1 minute to perform. As part of the installation process, the installer attempts a Heal check, the result of which is the DC of noticing the implant. Once a chip is implanted, its ingenious bioelectric circuits are powered by nerve impulses in the implanted creature's body.</p><p>Noticing an implanted tracker chip requires a full-round action to search the target creature and a successful Perception check equal to 10 + the result of the Heal check used to implant the chip. Extracting an installed tracker chip is a standard action that requires a slashing weapon or tool and deals 1 point of damage. Once installed, the tracker chip emits a signal that can be detected by any chipfinder in range. If removed from a body or its host dies, an activated tracked chip retains enough of a charge to continue to be detected by a chipfinder for 1 week.</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 250 gp, craft technological item, production lab
Trauma pack	1500 gp	<p>This small box of emergency medical gear can be used to augment a creature's Heal skill to allow for enhanced healing. A full trauma pack has enough supplies to be used 5 times before it is depleted. When using a trauma pack to provide healing, attempt a DC 15 Heal check as a standard action. If he succeeds, the pack provides 1d8+1 points of healing. For every 5 points by which the Heal check's result exceeds the DC, it provides an additional 1d8+1 points of healing.</p>	Craft DC 20; Cost 750 gp, craft technological item, medical lab
Trauma pack plus	11250 gp	<p>A trauma pack plus functions as a trauma pack, except that it's advanced chemicals and tools allow someone to restore a recently slain creature to life if the healing provided by the trauma pack plus is administered within 1 round of the target's death, as <i>breath of life</i>. A trauma pack heals 2d8+2 points of damage on a successful DC 15 Heal check. For every 5 points by which the result exceeds the DC, the pack provides an additional 2d8+2 points of healing.</p>	Craft DC 26; Cost 5,625 gp, craft technological item, medical lab
Veemod	varies	"<p>A veemod (""vision enhancement module"") is a narrow crystalline strip that slots into a set of veemod goggles to enhance the goggles' use. Inserting a veemod into a pair of goggles is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Veemods are color-coded items, and provide the following benefits.</p><p><b>Brown Veemod</b>: This veemod darkens the goggles' lenses, providing a +1 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against bright light effects that cause dazzling or blindness. When worn, they also allow creatures impacted by light blindness or light sensitivity to see normally in areas of bright light. </p><p><b>Black Veemod</b>: A black veemod enhances vision, and by blinking twice rapidly, the wearer can magnify what she's seeing. Blinking twice again restores normal vision. This grants a +2 competence bonus on all Perception checks.</p><p><b>White Veemod</b>: This veemod is similar to a black veemod, except that magnification is much stronger, granting a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.</p><p><b>Gray Veemod</b>: This veemod grants low-light vision.</p><p><b>Green Veemod</b>: This veemod magnifies vision even more than a white veemod, granting a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks.</p><p><b>Red Veemod</b>: This veemod grants darkvision to a range of 60 feet.</p><p><b>Blue Veemod</b>: This veemod dramatically extends the scope of peripheral vision, granting the effects of all-around vision—the wearer cannot be flanked.</p><p><b>Orange Veemod</b>: The wearer can see in darkness of any kind, including magical darkness.</p><p><b>Prismatic Veemod</b>: This veemod allows the user to see through solid objects. Vision range is 20 feet, with the wearer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 20 feet of cloth, wood, or similar animal or vegetable material. It can see through up to 10 feet of stone and some metals. It can see through up to 10 inches of iron, steel, copper, brass, or similar metals. It cannot see through lead, gold, platinum, plutonium, or skymetals at all. It's possible to scan an area of up to 100 square feet in 1 round. Secret compartments are 90% likely to be located by x-ray scanning.</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>"	
Veemod goggles	1000 gp	"<p>These goggles come in a variety of colors and shapes, but most are sleek and streamlined in appearance. The primary use for these goggles is to enhance vision via the application of a ""vision enhancement module,"" or ""veemod."" A pair of veemod goggles can be fitted with only one veemod at a time; attaching a veemod is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p><p>Veemod goggles consume charges only when a veemod is installed.
