The suit's helmet is close-fitting but offers excellent visibility, while the suit's fabric itself can flex while still remaining supportive against pressure-depths are treated as being 1,000 feet shallower than their actual depth for the purposes of determining pressure damage from deep water. The wearer is also immune to inhaled toxins and can breathe underwater with ease-the suit does not allow breathing in a vacuum.</p><p>A diving suit's hands and feet can activate webbing, long fins, and flippers, which the wearer can extend (and deactivate) as a move action. While in this mode, the wearer of the suit gains a swim speed of 20 feet and a +8 bonus on Swim checks, but the armor check penalty of the suit doubles to -4 and its land speed reduces to 20 feet (or 15 feet for slower characters, as appropriate). Swim checks are never penalized by a diving suit's armor check penalty.</p></description>

The armor bonus provided by an unpowered gravity suit is +0, but when activated, the suit generates a field of gravitons around the wearer that grants a +5 armor bonus (this bonus is a force effect). This bonus is doubled when it applies to the wearer's CMD score against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts, and slows any fall as if the wearer were under the effect of a <i>feather fall</i> spell.</p><p>At the cost of 1 additional charge per minute, the wearer of a gravity suit can fly at a speed of 60 ft.

The harness can be worn in conjunction with any other suit of armor-the armor bonus granted by the heavy weapon harness does not stack with that granted by other suits of armor, but the armor check penalties and spell failure percentages do.</p><p>A heavy weapon harness provides its wearer with additional stability and support, allowing the user to wield heavy weapons as if they were regular firearms, using the Exotic Weapon (firearms) feat for proficiency rather than Exotic Weapon (heavy weaponry). A character with Exotic Weapon (heavy weaponry) who wears an H-belt finds the use of heavy weapons even easier, and gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made with harnessed heavy weapons.</p><p>Unlike most technological armors, a heavy weapon harness does not use power-its components are purely mechanical.</p></description>

        <weight type="number">1200</weight>
        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 120; <b>Usage:</b> </p><p>An autodoc is a large, cumbersome device that consists of a comfortable, plastic-framed reclining chair inside a transparent pod, within which is affixed a dizzying array of multi-jointed arms and extendable devices. An equally dizzying assortment of buttons, lights, and touch-sensitive screens adorn the device, both on the inside and outside of the pod.</p> <p>An autodoc can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure disease, treat burns, implant cybertech, remove poison, and more. An autodoc can be programmed to perform any number of surgical procedures upon the person lying within the pod-the dozens of arms and devices work with precision and great speed. The operator need only enter in the proper diagnosis or desired operation on the screens at the foot of the bed with a successful Heal check; this requires the Technologist feat to attempt. The DC is based on the operation, detailed below. An autodoc will not activate until it has been properly programmed. Programming an operation takes 2d6 rounds of work. An autodoc has some capacity to error-check and auto-complete the correct programming for an operation before undertaking it by running instantaneous simulations on one of its many screens, granting the user a +5 circumstance bonus on these Heal checks.</p> <p>An autodoc consumes 1 charge per hour while idle (including time needed to program an operation), and 1 charge per round while operating. As an autodoc can only hold a maximum of 120 charges at a time, for lengthy operations it must be recharged during use or be attached to a standing power supply such as a generator or reactor. While functioning, an autodoc is closed tight-a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to wrench the door open. A patient who leaves or is forcibly removed from an autodoc before an operation finishes (or who is being operated on when the autodoc runs out of charges) must succeed a DC 15 Reflex save or take 3d6+10 points of damage from the cutting lasers, surgical tools, and needles moving at high speed. Needless to say, exiting the autodoc before an operation completes negates any of the benefits that would have been otherwise granted by the device.</p> <p>The various operations an autodoc can perform are as follows; additional operations can be devised as needed.</p>  <ul><li><b>Minor Surgery</b> (DC 15): The patient heals 1d8+1 points of damage. <i>Operation Time</i>:<b> </b>1 minute.</li> <li><b>Moderate Surgery</b> (DC 20): The patient heals 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. <i>Operation Time</i>: 2 minutes.</li> <li><b>Major Surgery</b> (DC 25): The patient heals 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. <i>Operation Time</i>: 3 minutes.</li> <li><b>Critical Surgery</b> (DC 30): The patient heals 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. <i>Operation Time</i>: 4 minutes.</li> <li><b>Back from the Brink</b> (DC 35): A dead patient whose body is relatively intact is restored to life at 1 hit point per Hit Die, as if by <i>raise dead</i> (including time restrictions and negative levels). <i>Operation Time</i>: 1 hour.</li> <li><b>Total Molecular Reconstruction</b> (DC 45): As long as at least a small amount of a patient's DNA is available, an autodoc can reconstruct a patient's body completely. At the end of the reconstruction process, the new body is considered to be a blank clone of the patient, and until the patient's memories and personality are implanted into the clone via a neurocam, the body remains alive but inert. <i>Operation Time</i>: 24 hours.</li> <li><b>Install Cybertech</b> (DC = the cybertech install DC): Cybernetic equipment is installed safely. <i>Operation Time</i>: 10 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being installed.</li> <li><b>Treat Toxin</b> (DC = 10 + the save DC of disease or poison): The patient has one disease or poison currently afflicting him removed. <i>Operation Time</i>: 10 minutes.</li></ul></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> ; <b>Usage:</b> 200 charges/day</p><p>This enclosed pod of metal and plastic contains a thinly padded bed on which to lay, and dozens of small vents along its interior. A rebirthing chamber cannot operate on its own power, and must be attached to an external power source. When a Small or Medium humanoid lies within a rebirthing chamber, the chamber automatically seals. Soporific gas fills the chamber, inducing a deathlike coma (Fortitude DC 30 each round negates; this is a poison effect). One minute after it seals, the chamber floods with nanites that first analyze, then reduce the occupant to its component molecules. The dismantling process deals 6d10 points of damage and 1d4 point of Constitution drain each round (Fortitude DC 30 half), a horrifically painful process should the occupant retain consciousness. Any gear worn by the occupant is dismantled and destroyed, with possibly catastrophic results for explosives and powered devices.</p> <p>Over the next 1d4 days, the nanites reconstruct and enhance the occupant, in effect optimizing its genetic code. The occupant wakes up with full memories of its prior existence, but in the body of a young adult of its race, halfway between the minimum and maximum age of its current age category. In the process, all ability scores receive a +2 inherent bonus.</p> <p>Each time a rebirthing chamber is used, there is a 10% chance its nanite reconstruction fails, leaving the host dead and without remains. Only a <i>miracle</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i> can restore such a hapless victim. The nanite reservoir contains sufficient nanites for five rebirths, assuming it hasn't been previously used.</p> <p>A rebirthing chamber only works on humanoids and humanoid corporeal undead. It can even restore life to a long-dead corpse, so long as usable genetic information remains, but with a 25% chance of failure instead of 10%. For each day that passed without preservation such as <i>gentle repose</i>, the revived creature loses roughly 10% of its memories and gains 1 permanent negative level. If the negative levels gained exceed the creature's level, the revival fails. Intelligent corporeal undead retain their memories after revival, but lose all undead abilities and regain their original statistics and abilities from their time among the living. Effects that restore these negative levels also restore these lost memories.</p> <p>Attempts to rebirth a creature without a soul invariably fail, as do attempts to rebirth a creature from partial remains while the creature is still alive. A body is created and draws breath, but it lacks any intellect and dies 2d6 hours after the process is completed. </p></description>

The leg is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular leg, although cyberart can be added to the leg at no additional cost. A cybernetic leg does not increase a user's Strength score. If both legs are replaced, they increase the user's base land speed by 10 feet and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against trip attempts and a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks.</p><p>The listed price, implantation, and install DC are for having two legs installed. A single cybernetic leg costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but no significant bonus is granted to a creature with only one cybernetic leg. Both legs (or all legs, in the case of multi-legged creatures) must be replaced for the above benefits to take effect.</p></description>

If administered to a corpse within 1 minute of death, the victim can immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 15 + 1 per round since death occurred) to be restored to life, automatically stabilizing at -1 hit point. Multiple doses injected within this 1-minute period can grant the deceased additional attempts at revival; each additional dose grants a cumulative +2 bonus to the Fortitude saving throw. As with most other effects that revive the dead, a creature restored to life in this manner gains 1 negative level. Cardioamp only works on bodies that are relatively intact. Bodies that have been dismembered, horribly burned, or otherwise mutilated (at the GM's discretion) cannot be revived by cardioamp, but bodies slain by death effects can be.</p><p>Cardioamp can be deadly if injected into a living creature. A living creature injected with cardioamp must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw to resist taking 3d6 points of Constitution damage from a sudden heart attack. If the save is successful, the Constitution damage is negated but the victim becomes sickened for 1d6 rounds. The effect when injected in a living creature is a poison effect.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> -; <b>Usage:</b> -</p><p>Most technological items are powered by electricity. While one can use the electricity provided by a generator, these are rare, expensive, and rarely portable. It's more common and practical to charge such items with batteries. A battery looks like a small silver disk that's etched with strange lines-some people have taken to calling batteries "silverdisks" and sometimes use them as coins. A battery contains 10 charges when full; to charge an item with a battery, one simply slips the disk-shaped device into the proper slot on the item. The battery's charge instantly fully depletes, and the item's internal capacitors fill with 10 charges as it does so. If the item had fewer than 10 open slots in its capacity, the excess charges the battery once held are lost. A battery can be kept within an object indefinitely, or it can be ejected from the object for the purposes of recharging it or storing it elsewhere without affecting the item's charge. Inserting or ejecting a battery is a move action.</p><p>Placing a battery in a generator's charging slot can recharge it. However, each time a battery is recharged, there's a 20% chance that the battery is destroyed in the process. A destroyed battery is worth only 10 gp. The bulk of "silverdisks" in circulation today are destroyed batteries; one can tell a functional battery from a destroyed one by the way the circuitry seems to shimmer slightly when reflecting light. The circuitry in a charged battery glows with a soft blue radiance equal to that of a candle.</p></description>

It takes a move action to attach a cable to a generator or a device-thus, it takes a full round to fully connect the two together. Once connected, the item draws power from the generator rather than from its internal battery stores. If an item can be recharged, it automatically replenishes its missing charges from the generator (up to the generator's available yield for that hour). This process is instantaneous. See Artifacts for more information on generators.</p></description>

A small slot situated below the window can accept genetic material (fingernails, hair clippings, skin samples, and so forth). When genetic material is placed in the slot, the clonepod immediately atomizes the sample and processes the genetic information. At this point, activating the clonepod causes its interior to flood with blue biotic fluid, which is then supersaturated with a combination of proteins, nanites, and other materials. Over the course of the next 12 hours, the clonepod works nonstop to produce an exact replica of the creature from which the genetic material was harvested, as the creature was when the sample was taken. A clonepod can only duplicate a Medium or smaller creature-attempts to clone a larger creature result in a hideous, partially formed monstrosity that heaves and gasps a few times before dying.</p><p>The completed clone can remain in stasis inside the pod indefinitely as long as the seals are not broken. The clone created is alive, yet has no mind until a neurocam is used to upload a mind into the clone's brain. A clone has the same Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the original body. A clone that is awoken before any mind is uploaded into it has no Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both 1.</p><p>Uploading a mind from a neurocam into a clone takes 10 minutes. If the mind belonged to the same creature that was used to grow the clone, it immediately comes back to life as if under the effects of a <i>clone</i> spell (including 2 negative levels or 2 points of Constitution drain)-provided the user's soul has not yet passed to the Boneyard and been judged.  It possesses the same Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of the original mind, all of that creature's skills, and most of the memories and personality of the creature (though there may be gaps or differences). A mind uploaded into a clone after its soul has been judged results in a soulless approximation of the original. Such a creature has its Charisma permanently reduced by 2 points (which cannot be restored), and has no ability to grow more powerful or gain levels (similar to a <i>simulacrum</i>).</p><p>If the clone's body and mind are not from the same source, all six ability scores are permanently reduced by 2 points.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 1; <b>Usage:</b> disposable </p><p>A neurocam consists of a strange helmet covered in flashing lights and adjustable straps with an intricate blinder that covers the eyes. This device is used to make a duplicate of a creature's mind, copying and storing all the knowledge, memories, and personality of a living creature. A neurocam can be adjusted to fit the head of any creature of size Tiny to Large. A neurocam interfaces with the subject's brain via a modulated beam of light that is transmitted through the optic nerves and several fine sensors that must press against the user's skull. Storing a person's mind takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted use; any interruption scrambles the pattern and ruins the neurocam. This process does not harm the target. An unwilling subject can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to resist a neurocam; if the subject is successful, the neurocam's contents are scrambled and the device is ruined.</p><p>A neurocam can store only one personality. Once used, it cannot store another even after the contents are uploaded elsewhere. A personality stored in a neurocam is effectively put into stasis-the mind does not age, nor does it gain new experiences or knowledge. It's cut off from the world, and though it experiences strange dreams, it isn't aware of the passage of time. If the neurocam is destroyed, the stored personality vanishes; however, loss of power does not harm a stored personality. </p><p>A stored personality can be uploaded only once. It can be uploaded into a blank clone in a clonepod. Additional processes to upload a stored personality into a robot or an AI core exist but are complex and often drive the stored personality insane.</p></description>

Once activated, the shelter rapidly unfolds and inflates into a 10-foot-radius hut capable of providing shelter for up to six Medium creatures. This process takes 1 minute to complete. The shelter includes pneumatic spike anchors that can attach it to any ground cover of hardness 8 or less. Several windows allow those inside to see outside. The interior contains several fluorescent lights. The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, and provides excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and purifies any noxious external air into breathable air. The hut has fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and acid resistance 10. The dense plastic walls have hardness 8 and 10 hit points. The hut cannot float on water. The door is self-sealing, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease for as long as the power holds out. As long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside an emergency shelter, it can be commanded at the touch of a button to compact back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute. After this point, the device consumes 1 charge over the course of 8 hours resetting its internal structure, limiting its deployment to 3 times a day at most.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 10 (disposable); <b>Usage:</b> 1 charge</p><p>This cylindrical device has a nozzle at one end and a handle on one side. When activated as a standard action, a fire extinguisher creates a 15-foot cone of misty vapor that swiftly extinguishes fires within its area of effect. Against magical fire effects, such as those created by a <i>wall of fire</i> or similar spell, the fire extinguisher only extinguishes the part of the larger effect its vapors directly contact. Continual magic flames, such as those of a <i>flaming</i> weapon or fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds before they automatically reignite. To extinguish an instantaneous fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect, provided the source of the effect is in the extinguisher's area of effect.</p><p>When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast from a fire extinguisher deals 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 15 halves). A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilated-using a fire extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in slow suffocation (at the GM's discretion).</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 10; <b>Usage:</b> 1 charge/round</p><p>A gravity clip is a small, disc-shaped device that can be attached to any melee weapon. Once mounted, the clip modulates the weapon's mass on the moment of impact, via the manipulation of the gravity fields around the weapon. Each successful hit against a target consumes a charge from a gravity clip and causes the damage from the hit to resolve as if the weapon were one size category larger than its actual size. This effect does not stack with similar effects, such as those granted by the spell <i>lead blades</i>.</p></description>

Once they're set, they can be locked into place to grip an object. Used when attempting to pry open a stuck object (in a manner similar to the use of a crowbar), grippers grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks. When used to attach two devices, a set of grippers holds on with an effective Strength score of 24. Applying grippers to a creature and then locking the grippers to crush flesh and bone is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and also requires a successful melee attack with an improvised weapon. Once locked, the grippers deal 1d4+7 points of damage.</p></description>

A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zip stick), the tape bonds together into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 30 hit points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many-it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 10; <b>Usage:</b> 1 charge</p><p>A robojack is a strange, rod-like device that can be used to usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In order to gain control of a robot, the wielder must first make a ranged touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the robot must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw to prevent the robojack from linking to the robot's command processor. On a subsequent turn after a link is established, the wielder can issue a command to the robot as a standard action-each attempt to do so consumes 1 charge from the robojack, and the robot gets a new DC 14 Will saving throw to resist following each command. The wielder must be within 60 feet of the robot and must issue the command in a language understood by the robot. The types of commands he can issue are similar to those allowed by a <i>suggestion</i> spell-once a command is successfully issued, the robot does its best to carry out the orders over the course of the next hour. This does not drain further charges from the robojack.</p></description>

Once installed, the tracker chip emits a signal that can be detected by any chipfinder in range.

The Technologist feat is not required to disable a high-tech trap or object, but such traps and objects often have significantly higher DCs to disable than low-tech versions of a similar device would have.</p> <p><i>Arm Explosive</i>: If you possess a detonator, you can arm an explosive weapon as a trap. Connecting a detonator to an explosive requires a successful DC 10 Disable Device check. Failure means that the attempt fails, but you can attempt to arm the explosive again.

To do so, choose a target disarm DC of 15 or higher, with a DC increment of 5. This becomes your target DC to set the explosive as well as the DC to disarm the explosive.</p> <p><i>Disable Electronic Lock or Trigger</i>: Disabling an electronic lock on a door or an electronic trigger for a trap (not the trap itself) is easier if you use an e-pick-without an e-pick, you take a -5 penalty on such checks.</p> <p><i>Disarm Explosive</i>: Disarming an explosive requires the character to succeed at a Disable Device check as if disarming a trap. The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the explosive successfully did so with a higher disarm DC. A failure to disarm an explosive by 5 or more immediately triggers the explosive.</p> <p><b>Special</b>: A character can take 10 when using Disable Device to arm or disarm explosives, but cannot take 20.</p> <p><b>Time</b>: Arming an explosive device takes 1 minute or more, depending on the scope of the job. Disarming an explosive is treated as if the explosive were a complex trap, and takes 2d4 rounds to attempt.</p></text>

Time spent within an <i>antitech field</i> counts against the suppressed effect's duration.</p> <p>Robots and other technological constructs that come in contact with an <i>antitech field</i> must attempt a Fortitude saving throw each round they remain in the field. Failure indicates a creature can take no actions that round and is considered to be helpless. Success indicates a creature can take either one move action or one standard action that round. Partially technological creatures like androids or cyborgs are merely staggered if they fail this saving throw. Note that cybernetic equipment does not function in an <i>antitech field</i>, and all benefits granted by such gear are suppressed.</p> <p>Non-technological creatures can enter the area, as can low-tech missiles like sling stones and arrows. High-tech missiles such as bullets and missiles immediately halt upon contacting the field, and either drop to the ground harmlessly or detonate. An antitech field doesn't stop rays created by magical sources, but does stop rays fired from beam weapons such as lasers. The <i>antitech field</i> does not offer any protection against explosions caused by technological explosives detonating against it-thus, creatures within the field could still take damage from a rocket that explodes against it. </p> <p>If a creature is larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of the creature that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.</p> <p>This spell can be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p>This spell functions like <i>remove radioactivity</i>, save that it cures all ability damage and drain due to radioactivity that the target has taken. In addition, you can deplete a radioactive object as well, although because you must touch the object to affect it, you expose yourself to at least 1 round of contact with the object's radiation. You must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 5 + the Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect) in order to deplete the object. If you are successful, the object no longer emits radiation. In the case of a nuclear reactor or atomic warhead, this permanently renders the reactor or warhead inert and harmless.</p></description>

When activated, a laser torch emits a beam of highly focused light, cutting and burning through surfaces up to 6 inches away. Attacks from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d10 points of fire damage. This damage is not modified further by Strength. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as a weapon to sunder, its damage bypasses up to 20 points of hardness, and damage is not halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless the object is particularly fire-resistant. A laser torch's cutting beam passes through force fields and force effects without damaging the field. Invisible objects and creatures can't be harmed by a laser torch.</p></description>

An inactive monowhip looks like a short metal baton, but when it's activated, a small weight detaches, revealing a 15-foot-long monofilament length. Wielded like a whip, a monowhip slices deeply into targets and can inflict grievous critical hits with shocking ease. Attacks made with a monowhip resolve as touch attacks, and they ignore hardness as if the monofilament were made of adamantine. A monowhip's damage cannot be enhanced by strength, as the monofilament slices with equal ease regardless of the force applied. Activating a monowhip is a move action; once activated, the whip consumes power incredibly quickly, at the rate of 1 charge per round.</p></description>

A chainsaw consists of a weighty housing for the engine and power source that is fitted with two handles, and a 2- to 3-foot-long blade extending from the front, around which a whirling, buzzing chain of razor-sharp cutting links spins at blinding speed when the weapon is activated. It's a standard action to activate a chainsaw, and doing so consumes a charge of power. The chainsaw continues to run constantly after activation, draining an additional charge each hour. A dropped chainsaw automatically turns off unless it is set down carefully as a move action. The buzzing of a chainsaw's blade is loud and distracting (but not deafening), causing anyone carrying an activated chainsaw to take a -10 penalty on Stealth checks. An activated chainsaw grants a proficient user a +2 morale bonus on Intimidate checks.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 1 nanite canister; <b>Usage:</b> Varies</p><p>A death ray is a handheld, wand-like weapon that fires a harmless carrier beam of energy at a target. When the beam hits a target, the death ray then projects a stream of specialized nanites through the beam into the body of the target. When firing a death ray, the wielder must decide how many charges of nanites she is consuming, to a maximum of 10. Even if the wielder engineers a method of using a larger reserve of nanites than normally come in a canister, this maximum does not increase. Immediately upon being struck, the nanites inflict incredible pain on the target, which must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw to avoid a grisly fate (DC = 10 + twice the number of charges consumed by the attack). For example, if 1 charge is consumed, the target must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the death ray, but if all 10 charges are consumed in the attack, the DC to resist the effects is 30.</p><p>If the target fails this save, it takes 100 points of damage as the nanites tear apart the victim's cardiovascular system. On a successful saving throw, the victim takes only 6d6 points of damage. Creatures slain by a death ray die spectacularly, seeming to melt into a pool of blood that swiftly fades away. The victim's gear is unaffected by this attack. A death ray has no effect on creatures that aren't living (such as constructs or undead) and can't penetrate a force field. The wielder can't score critical hits with a death ray. A death ray has a maximum range of 200 feet with no range increment.</p></description>

A flare gun and its ammunition (a small, rocket-propelled magnesium charge) are completely self-contained and disposable-once fired, a flare gun is useless. While a flare gun has excellent range, the flare tends to wobble and spiral in flight, incurring a 20% miss chance if it's being used to target a specific point. The flare detonates once it hits a target or reaches its maximum range of 2,400 feet, bursting into a sphere of fire that illuminates a 120-foot-radius area for 1 minute as it drifts slowly back to the ground. Any creatures within 20 feet of the flare must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw each round or be dazzled by the intense light for as long as they remain in the area. Creatures adjacent to a lit flare are also blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A creature struck by a flare takes 1d8 points of fire damage (1d6 points of fire damage from Small flare guns), and continues to take the same amount of fire damage each round until the flare is removed. Removing a flare is a full-round action.</p></description>

It uses a focused beam of gravitons to create a bolt of force. A gravity pistol has two settings-switching between settings is a swift action. On its pulse setting, it can be used as a typical beam weapon, but on it sustained setting, holding the pistol's trigger down creates a stable beam of gravitons rather than a short, destructive burst. In this mode, the gravity pistol can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance, similar to a <i>telekinesis</i> spell in its sustained force or combat maneuver versions (a gravity pistol cannot duplicate the violent thrust option of a <i>telekinesis</i> spell). In this mode, a gravity pistol consumes 1 charge per round. The graviton beam can move objects weighing no more than 225 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the beam uses the wielder's CMB, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><p><b>Capacity:</b> 1 nanite canister; <b>Usage:</b> 1 charge</p><p>An id rifle looks like a sleek, low-caliber rifle made of burnished skymetal. It fires a tiny barb of solid nanites with a range increment of 50 feet. Although this barb does minimal damage on a hit, any creature damaged by an id rifle barb must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or have its central nervous system flooded with nanites that swiftly overwhelm the creature's brain, reducing its mind to the instinctive level of an animal. The victim takes 1d4 points of Intelligence damage each round, but the total amount of damage taken can never equal the victim's actual Intelligence score. Each round after the first, the victim can resist the Intelligence damage by succeeding at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw, at which point the damage ceases. The recurring Intelligence damage automatically ends after 6 rounds. A victim already suffering from the effects of an id rifle who is affected by an additional shot has the save DC increased by 2 per additional shot.</p><p>An id rifle has a microphone built into its stock. During any round in which a creature takes Intelligence damage from an id rifle, as a move action the wielder of that rifle can speak a short command into the microphone. Any applicable target within 50 feet of the wielder must then succeed at a DC 16 Will save to resist following the command, as if under the effect of a <i>suggestion</i> spell. A victim follows only the latest suggestion spoken into the microphone, and abandons any previous suggestion if it fails a saving throw against a new suggestion. A victim continues to follow the suggestion for up to 5 hours after succumbing to its effects.</p><p>The effects created by an id rifle are mind-affecting effects.</p></description>

An atom gun's range is relatively short, and the weapon can fire only scattering shots. The beams of radiation created when the wielder fires an atom gun do not fill the cone in a homogeneous area, and she must still make a ranged touch attack to irradiate a target. A creature struck by an atom gun attack suffers the effects of medium radiation. The small core of radioactive material in an atom gun is powerful enough to keep the weapon charged for tens of thousands of years, but the weapon becomes incredibly hot when fired, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the user and subsequently beginning a cool-down protocol, during which the weapon cannot be fired for 1 minute.</p><p>An atom gun cannot be fired more than 3 times per day. A functional atom gun's power source is shielded well, and the gun itself is not a source of dangerous radioactivity. If an atom gun gains the broken condition, it begins to leak radiation and becomes a source of low radiation to all creatures that touch it. An atom gun that gains the destroyed condition becomes a source of high radiation to those in contact with it, a source of medium radiation to those within 10 feet of it, and a source of low radiation to those within 30 feet of it.</p></description>

The wielder takes a -4 penalty on any Stealth checks made while it is active. It can be powered off completely to negate this penalty; either activating or deactivating is a standard action.</p><p>When this weapon is fired, it creates a highly focused beam of sound that swiftly modulates to resonate at the atomic frequencies of the first target it strikes. The wielder make one attack roll when firing a nuclear resonator, then resolves that roll against the Armor Class of every creature in an 80 foot line from his position. The resonator's beam tunes itself to the precise molecular structure of the first creature in the line he hits, dealing 9d6 points of sonic damage to that target. Any other targets of the same creature type in the line which are subsequently struck take 5d6 points of sonic damage, while creatures of different types than the initial target take 3d6 points of sonic damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target hit by the attack to resolve the critical confirmation against. A creature that's critically hit by a nuclear resonator must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to resist being stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds.

This energy tears, crushes, and twists everything in its path. Being struck by a vortex gun induces overwhelming vertigo in living victims. A living creature damaged by a vortex gun must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A critical hit also allows the user of the gun to attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 15); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Flying creatures struck by a vortex gun are affected as if they were struck by hurricane force winds. A creature protected by a force field takes no damage from a vortex gun but must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or the shot automatically depletes all of the force field's remaining hit points.</p></description>
